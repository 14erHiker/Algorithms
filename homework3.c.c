/*
Q3. (Guess the Number) Write a C program that plays the game of “guess the number” as follows:
Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range
1 to 1000. The program then types:

I have a number between 1 and 1000.
Can you guess my number?
Please type your first guess.

The player then types a first guess. The program responds with one of the following:

1. Excellent! You guessed the number!
    Would you like to play again (y or n)?
2. Too low. Try again.
3. Too high. Try again.

If the player’s guess is incorrect, your program should loop until the player finally gets the number
right. Your program should keep telling the player Too high or Too low to help the player “zero in”
on the correct answer. 

Count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, print Either you know the secret or you got lucky! If the player guesses the number in 10 tries, then print “Ahah! You know the secret!”

If the player makes more than 10 guesses, then print “You should be able to do better!” Why should it take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each “good guess” the player should be able to eliminate half of the numbers. Now show why any number 1 to 1000 can be guessed in 10 or fewer tries.
